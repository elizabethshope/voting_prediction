# Voting Predictions

This is a repository for a Bayesian statistics project creating voting predictions using Bayesian inference for logistic regression.

The original data for this project comes from a survey done by YouGov and is posted on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/democracy-fund/2016-voter-survey. The subset of data we are using for this project is in the voter_subset.csv file. We are then simplifying and processing this data with the file data_processing.R.
